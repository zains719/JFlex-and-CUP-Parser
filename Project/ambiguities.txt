---Ambiguitites---

1. There is no explicit mention of the syntax of comments in the project.pdf. There are only single line comment examples in the snippets of code provided.
   However, some of the tests invlolved multi line comments. Therefore I had to adjust the lexer and parser to satisfy multiline comments despite there being no mention of them in the pdf.

2. It is not specifically clear whether the parametrs for the range function are simply restricted to integers or could also be expressions evaluauted to integers. 
   Therefore I built my lexer and parser with the assumption of the parameter being able to accept expressions which evaluate to integers.

3. There is also some slight ambiguity in regards to what is confined to a floating point number. The pdf does not detail whether an integer such as 5 could also be considered as a float. 
   Hence, with my definition for floating point numbers I have decided to assume the latter.
